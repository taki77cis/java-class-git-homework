This is the web app for the Student Management server project.

To build, run `make build` with or without a NODE_ENV environment variable set.
This variable is used to set the Webpack build mode. For example, building for
dev would be done like this: `make build NODE_ENV=development`. The default
mode is "production". Make sure you run `make deps` or `npm i` to download
dependencies.

The dev server is started with the `make server` command and the same rules for
the NODE_ENV variable apply. Requests made to the "/api/" endpoint are proxied
to localhost:3000 which is the default address for the Java app.

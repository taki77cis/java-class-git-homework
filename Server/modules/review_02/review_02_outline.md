# Java cert prep class (Review 2)

## Summary

We learned about the grammar and language rules we must follow when programming
in Java. Covered entry points, which are special methods or parts of code where
our program will always start from. There is just one entry point per program
and in Java it is the `main` method. Finally, we covered why good style
matters in programming.

## TODO:

- Slides for class. Marcos will start putting together the slides. But we need
  to decide who is going to talk about what.

- Compile list of homework. Come up with good description for all assignments
  that we can put in writing and examplain during class.

- Pick an assignment (probably Hangman) and figure out how we are going to use
  use it as an example to teach and review what we would like to cover during
  class.

- Stretch: think about how can we start incorporating javax.swing into future
  classes.


## Review topics:

- What code goes where?
  Where can I put statements?
  Where can I put variable declarations?
  Where can I put method declarations?

- Coding style
  Identation and why it helps

- What is the purpose of the main method?
  Why doesn't every class have a main method?


## During class:

- Use Hangman as an example.

- Project code on to the whiteboard and highlight (using markers) where code
  starts and where it ends. We could use this to review the "What code goes
  where?" and "Coding style" sections.

- Be the computer exercises.
  Nested loops.
  Nested methods where the child does some tricky stuff.

### More of a project type of homework

- _DONE http://programmingbydoing.com/a/baby-calculator.html_
- _DONE-ish http://programmingbydoing.com/a/project-calculator.html_

### Functions

- We could take any of the previous assignments and make sure methods are used.
  There are also plenly of options we could take from Programming by Doing:

### Classes

- There are some assignments we could make sure we use classes in, like in the
  calculator ones.

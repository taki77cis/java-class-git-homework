For each of the following problems figure out the output type. The available options are:
1. `byte`
1. `short`
1. `int`
1. `long`
1. `float`
1. `double`
1. `char`
1. fails to compile

You may use a computer to work out the answers. Make sure to guess before running code.

### 1. What is the output type of the following:
```java
long x = 5;
long y = 6;
x + y;
```

### 2. What is the output type of the following:
```java
float x = 2.1;
double y = 3.2;
x - y;
```

### 3. What is the output type of the following:
```java
short x = 7;
int y = 6;
x * y;
```

### 4. What is the output type of the following:
```java
byte x = 0;
short y = 3;
x + y;
```

### 5. What is the output type of the following:
```java
long x = 200;
double y = 3.5;
x / y;
```

### 6. What is the output type of the following:
```java
byte x = 3;
long y = 72;
x * y;
```

### 7. What is the output type of the following:
```java
float x = 3.1f;
long y = 10000;
x / y;
```

### 8. What is the output type of the following:
```java
char x = 'a';
int y = 2;
x + y;
```

### 9. What is the output type of the following:
```java
int x = 32;
int y = 2;
(double) x / y;
```

### 10. What is the output type of the following:
```java
float x = 32;
float y = 2;
(int) x * (int) y;
```

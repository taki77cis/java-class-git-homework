### Homework (Lesson 2)

**Q1)** With just ints and for-loops, recreate this pattern:
```java
1
22
333
44444
555555
4444
333
22
1
```
**Q2)** Write your own switch statement with:
 * at least one ```break;```
 * a ```default:``` statement

**Q3)** Write your own if-blocks that use the following at least once:
* ```!```,```<=``` OR```>=```, ```&&```, ```||```
* Multiple clauses in one statement.
* If and else.
* If, else if, and else.


**Q4)** Use for loops and the [modulo operator](https://javaranch.com/drive/modulo.html) ```%``` to find every number divisible by 6 between 0 and 100 and print it to console. (0, 6, 12, 18, 24....)
Consider this example:
```java
int x = 4;
if( x % 2 == 0){
    System.out.println("The number " + x + " is even");
}

```
